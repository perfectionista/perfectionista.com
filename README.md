Antillectual beggar and lessons about the ourliving habits

There was a beggar who came to Jack's house asking for alms and help. Jack immediately gave him 10 euros

On the second day, he continued to go to Jack's house and received another 10 euros. This went on for 2 years. One day suddenly, "philanthropist" only gave the beggar 5 euros

"Why did you only give me 5 euros this time?" - the beggar asked. Jack immediately complained: Because I was married.

Unexpectedly, the beggar rushed in front of the person who gave him the money for the past 2 years with an earlobe: "Damn, dare you take my money to support your wife?"


Lesson learned from the beggar's story for all of us: Do not give anything or provide any free service for too long, especially in business because that way customers will form an inherent habit.
Then, this approach will no longer be the advantage to help us achieve the goal, but on the contrary, it will backfire.
